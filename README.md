# Introduction

Print Scripts for frappe/erpnext replace the standard print formats of erpnext. The Client Scripts are mainly designed to fullfil custom user-interface task like dialogs or automatisms that have been requested by a or more customer. The Server Scripts are mainly designed to manipulate the workflows of erpnext and directly change database entries without applying user role permissions. Some tasks require both or multilayher scripts. All of the above come most often as a Serviceproject for a client/customer.

In addition to the raw logic and functions in this repository we apply the tueit-handbook to document and communicate our work. This repository is neccessary for version-keeping and collaboration.

The last but not least category are Restful Scripts, mainly used for Export-/Import or Interfaceintegration Projects.
